# My Coding Style

## The purpose of this document is to foster a more coherent coding style in languages that I use on a daily basis (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP). I came to the conclusion that both creating as well as *trying* to follow an own coding standards guide will help me become a bit of a better programmer. This document is a work in progress.
