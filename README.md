# My Coding Style


## The purpose of this document is to foster a more coherent coding style in languages that I use on a daily basis (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP). I came to the conclusion that both creating as well as *trying* to follow an own coding standards guide will help me become a bit of a better programmer. This document is a work in progress.


## Contents

* [Markup (HTML)](https://github.com/jancbeck/My-Coding-Style/blob/master/markup.md)
* [Styling (CSS/LESS)](https://github.com/jancbeck/My-Coding-Style/blob/master/styling.md)
* [Behavior (JavaScript)](https://github.com/jancbeck/My-Coding-Style/blob/master/behavior.md)
* [Serving (PHP)](https://github.com/jancbeck/My-Coding-Style/blob/master/serving.md)


## Conventions
I have borrowed a terminology convention by the NASAs [JPL Institutional Coding Standard for the C Programming Language](http://lars-lab.jpl.nasa.gov/JPL_Coding_Standard_C.pdf):

> The use of the verbs **shall** and **should** have the following meaning in this document. 
> * **Shall** indicates a requirement that must be followed [...].  
> * **Should** indicates a preference that must be addressed, but with deviations 
> allowed, provided that an adequate justification is given for each deviation.  

For prosaic reasons, *shall* and *should* are sometimes replaced by *must* and *can*.
