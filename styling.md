## General Principles

### Preprocessors
As of the writing of this document I'm using LESS on almost every project and because of it's very native feeling I don't really seperate CSS and LESS in my head. 
LESS is a superset of CSS. Basic patterns when writing CSS like indenting properties obviously also apply when creating a mixing with variables and guards in LESS and rules like nesting rules just don't apply when writing plain CSS. That's why in this document both are mixed.
